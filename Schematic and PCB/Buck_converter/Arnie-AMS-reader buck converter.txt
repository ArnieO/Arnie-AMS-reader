Objective
Pull the required energy from AMS HAN port to power an ESP8266 that transmits AMS data to home automation system via MQTT.

Challenge
The Kamstrup AMS unit is the one used in Norway that allows the lowest current pull from the HAN port: Maximum 144 mW / 6 mA.
As the other AMS brands can deliver more power, a HW solution that works for Kamstrup will also work with the other brands (Aidon, Kaifa)

Realistic available power at 3,3V
A buck converter with 75% efficiency would deliver 144 mW * 75% = 108 mW at 3,3V
This is 108 mW / 3,3V = 33 mA to the ESP (in average). 
It is assumed possible to tweek the ESP code to achieve this. Worst case, I would be happy to transmit only the small packages, and reduce the transmission rate.
The Kamstrup transmits "short list" data every 10 seconds.
